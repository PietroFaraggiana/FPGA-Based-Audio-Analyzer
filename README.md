# FPGA-Based-Audio-Analyzer
FPGA (Altera DE2) Audio Analyzer. This repository hosts the Verilog HDL source code and supporting documentation for a digital signal processing project implemented on the Altera DE2 development board. The system functions as a dual-mode spectrum and I/Q analyzer, processing real-time audio input and visualizing the results via a VGA interface.
